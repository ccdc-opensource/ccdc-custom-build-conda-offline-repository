# This condarc file is used to force use of the conda-forge repositories
# when installing new packages
# It is used to create the offline channel used by the installers
# and added to the generated miniconda environment to maintain consistency
# 
# CCDC tests the python scripts with these conda-forge packages and with pip
# Changing channel priority or adding repositories is untested
# 

# According to this page, strict channel priority is required
# and conda-forge must be on top, as order is important
# https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/introduction.html
# when conda-forge is on top, the conda solver will
# download way more packages, including updated qt, the clang compiler etc
# but this seems to be the only way to make solving work on all platforms
